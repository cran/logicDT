Description: A global statistical learning method
  which tries to find the best set of predictors and interactions
  between predictors for modeling binary or quantitative response data.
  Several search algorithms and ensembling techniques are implemented
  allowing for finetuning the method to the specific problem.
  Interactions with single quantitative covariables can be properly
  taken into account by also splitting after those or by fitting
  local four parameter logistic models.
